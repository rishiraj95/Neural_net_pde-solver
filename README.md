# Neural_net_pde-solver
This project explores the capabilities of neural networks to solve partial differential equations.

'neural_net.py' is the neural network class which defines the neural network architechtures we are using.
'problem_domain.py' describes the different problems that we wish to solve using this method.
For each problem it contains the description of the attributes particular to the problem.
'run_nn.py' integrates the different classes and trians the neural network
